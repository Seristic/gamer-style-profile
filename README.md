## 🏳️‍⚧️ My Journey & Recent Milestones

Hello! I’m Seristic, a passionate developer and proud member of the trans community.  
This profile is not just a showcase of code but a celebration of identity, resilience, and growth.

### Timeline of My Journey

| Year | Milestone |
|-------|------------|
| 2020 | Was in College studying in Computing Science  |
| 2022 | Came out as trans and started integrating my identity into my work and community. |
| 2025 | {{RECENT_LABEL}} Endured the impact of a [devastating ruling](https://example-link-to-news) undermining trans rights — a stark reminder of the ongoing fight for dignity and existence. |

> *“Coding my story, one commit at a time — proud, visible, unstoppable.”*
